# Pi1551-III Module-rotated
This is the main PCB and holds most of the active components. It is designed to be used with [Pi1551-III Module Panel](../Pi1551-III%20Module%20Panel) (see its [BOM](../Pi1551-III%20Module%20Panel/README.md#3-bom) when ordering). The Raspberry Pi footprint is rotated 180° so USB and HDMI are accessible; we recommend **not** installing the barrel jack (J1) or the 470 µF capacitor (C6)—power the device from the Raspberry Pi’s USB Micro port.

# 1> Build instructions
Assembly of this module is described in the top-level [README Assembly section](../README.md#3-assembly): start with the smallest parts first (SMD if hand-soldering, then buzzer, RPi GPIO header, TCBM connector, MiniDIN-7). The BOM for this module is [below](#3-bom).


# 2> Schematic
The supplied KiCad files should be sufficient as both a schematic and as a  starting point for ordering PCBs (basically you could just zip the contents of the export folder and upload that on a fabrication site), the schematic is also available in [PDF-format](../documentation/schematic) (if present in this repo) for when things don’t work as expected after assembly.

# 3> BOM
This BOM matches the schematic in this folder. Optional parts in parentheses. Gerbers, a BOM with JLCPCB part numbers, and SMD position data are in the [Releases](https://github.com/ytmytm/Pi1551-III/releases) section.

**\*** Recommended not to install J1 (barrel jack) or C6 (470 µF). Power the device from the Raspberry Pi’s USB Micro port.

**D2 (Schottky):** Orient with the cathode stripe towards the silkscreen mark.

1) For LEDs on [Pi1551-III Module Panel](../Pi1551-III%20Module%20Panel); 470 Ω suits most coloured LEDs — use a higher value for blue or "bright" types.
2) M3 nylon standoff kits usually contain what you need; check quantities.
3) Only when *not* installing bottom faceplate ([Pi1551-III Faceplate FB2](../faceplates/Pi1551-III%20Module%20FB2)).
